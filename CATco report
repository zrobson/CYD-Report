/*

notes:

- credit amount > recognition credit (so keep credit amount)
- talk with paul about adding in geo code, gift officers, and mg model scores


when I use mv_ksm_transactions with no filter, the extra people who were not in the CAtracks version are corporations or matching gifts

maybe remove this filter:     and (ksm_af_flag = 'Y' or ksm_cru_flag = 'Y')
These ids still aren't showing up after removing this filter. and now there is maybe 100 extra rows in the catco verison
0000048220
0000367570
0000383490
0000624460
0000667883
0000708544
0000734556



ADD LGO AND PMS and geo code (wait until its ready) --> stg_alumni

!!!!!!!

end up separating out into two tabs: one for people who gave cash this year, and one tab for people who only made commitments (pledges), if they did both, put on cash tab
