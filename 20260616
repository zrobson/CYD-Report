notes:

- credit amount > recognition credit (so keep credit amount)
- talk with paul about adding in geo code & mg model scores (wait until data is ready) --> stg_alumni

end up separating out into two tabs: one for people who gave cash this year, and one tab for people who only made commitments (pledges), if they did both, put on cash tab

Am I joining the v ksm giving summary view correctly?

ask if we can get more pledge data in giving view (pledge lifetime giving and pledge totals cfy-pfy5
